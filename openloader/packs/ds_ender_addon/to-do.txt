graphics:
- make cast bar better

    - make floating items "better"
    - tail can be more wobbly in one of the continuous animations
- implement some skin editior options
    - runic scales
    - neck/tail stripes

    - vibing
- fix wing and stage icon texture
- add some icon for rejuvenate ability effect other than the default one (prob just an end crystal)
- test sophiscated backpacks and other players mounting

- make enchanted scales 3-4 icon shifted by 1-2 pixels
- reduce saturation/increase brightness of the last level of rejuvenate icon
- armor and claw item textures

- add icons for several more abilities

gameplay:

- ritual abilities (require 4 end crystals within 20 blocks to work):

- add "purification" as a ritual ability - remove dragon-related debuffs from nearby players, including ender dragon's curse
- add a ritual ability to open a portal into the end dimension and back

- make abilities dispellable by applying "magic disabled" effect

- balancing i guess
- make crystal charge grant mana instead of consuming it, but reduce mana all over the place, increase base mana
- set up some attributes for growth stages and the body itself
- perhaps simplify some attributes
- also make all damaged players gain dragon breath when holding a bottle

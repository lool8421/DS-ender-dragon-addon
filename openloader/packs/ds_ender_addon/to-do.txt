graphics:
- make cast bar better
- brighter mana color
- finish animating, obviously:
    - breath
    - tail can be more wobbly in one of the continuous animations
- implement some skin editior options
- make like 10-20 emotes, most importantly:
    - leaning on wall
    - vibing
    - "battle scream" thing
    - laying on back
    - spinning on back (slow, fast and absurd)
- fix wing and stage icon texture
- add some icon for rejuvenate ability effect other than the default one (prob just an end crystal)
- test sophiscated backpacks and other players mounting
- remove aura particles from crystal heal 
- make enchanted scales 3-4 icon shifted by 1-2 pixels
- reduce saturation/increase brightness of the last level of rejuvenate icon

gameplay:
- rename "conjure egg" to "conjure-self", make it consume only 10 levels and make it faster 
- make "conjure-self" a "ritual ability"
- add "purification ritual" as an ability - remove dragon-related debuffs from nearby players, including ender dragon's curse
- ritual abilities require 4 crystals in the 20 block radius to work, otherwise casting will fail
    Make "conjure-self" ability grant dragon loot from other mods:
    - draconic evolution
    - quark
    - dragon egg (vanilla)

- balancing i guess
- make crystal charge grant mana instead of consuming it, but reduce mana all over the place, increase base mana
- set up some attributes for growth stages and the body itself
- perhaps simplify some attributes
- make dragon fireball have an assigned owner
- and don't damage mobs that have the same owner as the fireball
- also make all damaged players gain dragon breath when holding a bottle
- potentially make endermen truly not get mad when stared at with java stuff, alternatively give some "protective aura" against their anger
